# HHPF Values

## Preface
<h3>-- A Manifesto for Idealists</h3>

> HHPF is not a traditional commercial company, nor a rigid academic institution. We are a <b>"conscience-driven scientific community"</b>.
> Here, we are not only committed to cracking the code of human diseases, but also to reshaping the warmth of medical civilization. Our values are not hung on walls, but engraved in code, integrated into SOPs, and flowing in every comfort given to patients.


## I. Truth (Truth) —— Follow Only the Truth, Not Books or Superiors
<b>——This is our scientific attitude</b>

HHPF is an organization built on "first principles". We maintain respect for all established authorities, but skepticism toward all unproven dogmas.

*   <b>First Principles Thinking:</b>
    We strip away all empirical appearances (whether Western medicine guidelines or traditional Chinese medicine heritage) and go straight to the underlying logic of the life system. At HHPF, <b>"Because it has always been this way" is never a reason; only "Logic and data prove it is this way" is a reason.</b>
*   <b>De-mystification and Evidence-Based:</b>
    We are committed to demystifying natural therapies. No metaphysics, no fraud. All therapeutic effects must withstand A/B testing, and all conclusions must be supported by data.
*   <b>Honest About Ignorance:</b>
    Know what you know, and know what you don't know. In the face of the grand system of life, we acknowledge our current limitations and never exaggerate therapeutic effects or create anxiety for commercial gain.



## II. Benevolence (Benevolence) —— Technology is Skill, Compassion is the Way
<b>——This is our humanistic foundation</b>

HHPF possesses powerful AI technology and medical resources, but technology is neutral, and only "goodwill" can give it direction.

*   <b>Tech for Good:</b>
    The sole purpose of our developing SMD AI and writing SOPs is to lower medical thresholds, not raise barriers. <b>Allowing the poorest people to also enjoy the medical achievements of human civilization</b> is our inviolable bottom line.
*   <b>Patient Centric:</b>
    In our eyes, there are no "case numbers", only vivid "people". We not only care about "how to treat diseases", but also "how people live". All business model designs must give way to the dignity and well-being of life.
*   <b>Altruism is Self-Interest:</b>
    We firmly believe that in an interconnected system, the greatest selfishness is selflessness. By solving the most painful health problems of humanity, HHPF will naturally gain the due social respect and resource feedback.



## III. Evolution (Evolution) —— Embrace Uncertainty, Lifelong Growth
<b>——This is our action guideline</b>

HHPF is committed to promoting a paradigm shift, which means we are destined to walk in the no-man's land.

*   <b>Embrace Change:</b>
    We are challengers of the old order and builders of the new order. When SMD data proves yesterday's plan was wrong, we will not hesitate to overthrow ourselves. <b>Iteration speed is our lifeline.</b>
*   <b>Enlightenment Growth:</b>
    Every member of HHPF (employee/volunteer) must be a practitioner of "Enlightenment Training". We require the team to first upgrade their own "operating system", with stable emotions, clear awareness, and strong mental strength, before they can heal others.
*   <b>Hacker Spirit:</b>
    Use the smallest resources to leverage the biggest changes. We want to be like hackers looking for "backdoors" (self-healing switches) in the human body system, using engineering thinking to solve complex biological problems.



## IV. Oneness (Oneness) —— Break Boundaries, System Symbiosis
<b>——This is our ultimate pursuit</b>

Life systems theory tells us that everything is interconnected. HHPF opposes all forms of division and opposition.

*   <b>Break Disciplinary Barriers:</b>
    At HHPF, Western medicine does not despise traditional Chinese medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine does not reject technology. We integrate various therapies into one furnace, with the only evaluation criterion being "effectiveness". We are <b>"medical integrators"</b>.
*   <b>Integration of Medical Care, Wellness, Commerce, and Charity:</b>
    We want to break the binary opposition between charity and commerce, proving that kind business is the biggest business. We pursue win-win outcomes for the team, users, society, and natural environment.
*   <b>Unity of Heaven and Man:</b>
    The lifestyle we advocate is not only healing for the body, but also healing for the Earth. Returning to nature and following the way of heaven is the highest dimension of wisdom for HHPF.

## [Conclusion: Because We Believe, We Can See]
Members of HHPF are a group of <b>"down-to-earth idealists"</b>.
We hold scalpels and code (Truth), with compassion and great love (Benevolence), promote change with thunderous means (Evolution), and ultimately lead humanity into a new era of physical and mental harmony (Oneness).

If you also agree with these four iron rules, you are welcome to join us and become a partner in this health revolution.
