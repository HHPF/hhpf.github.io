# Intellectual Property

## Preface
<h3>-- Cornerstone of Credibility, Line of Defense for Life</h3>

> The intellectual property of the Human Health Plan Foundation (HHPF) is the cornerstone of credibility for our global services. When users see the HHPF or SMD logo, they trust a set of rigorously verified, high-standard health solutions.
Therefore, protecting HHPF's intellectual property is essentially <b>protecting the life safety of every user</b>, preventing them from being harmed by counterfeit medical services. We will spare no effort to establish and defend this rights system globally.



## I. Trademarks (Trademarks) —— Brand Identity Shield
We have exclusive rights to the names, logos, and slogans that represent HHPF's service quality.

1.  <b>Core Registered Trademarks:</b>
    HHPF has applied for or registered the following trademarks in major operating countries/regions:
    *   <b>Institutional Brands:</b> "HHPF", "Human Health Plan Foundation", "人类健康计划基金会".
    *   <b>Technology Brands:</b> "SMD", "Systems Medicine Doctor", "系统医学医师".
    *   <b>Project Brands:</b> "正觉训练营", "Enlightenment Bootcamp".
2.  <b>Visual Identity (VI):</b>
    HHPF's unique Logo graphics (and their combinations), specific brand color value combinations, are all protected by trademark law.
3.  <b>Prohibited Behaviors:</b>
    Without authorization, no third party may use the above trademarks or use similar identifiers that may cause confusion (such as "HHPF International", "SMD Smart Medical", and other edge-ball names) in medical institutions, health centers, drugs, health products, APPs, or promotional materials.



## II. Patents (Patents) —— Technological Innovation Shield
HHPF is not only an advocate of ideas but also a medical technology innovator. We have patent sovereignty over the technical achievements produced by the implementation of the "Health Engineering Methodology."

1.  <b>Invention Patents:</b>
    *   <b>SMD Algorithm Logic:</b> HHPF holds patent application rights for the specific algorithm models and multimodal diagnosis and treatment recommendation logic that integrate "Traditional Chinese and Western medicine data + natural therapy SOPs."
    *   <b>Biofeedback System:</b> The technical implementation path of the "brainwave-emotion" real-time feedback system used in the Enlightenment Bootcamp.
2.  <b>Utility Models & Designs:</b>
    *   <b>HHPF Custom Equipment:</b> Specific physical therapy devices we have developed (such as intelligent moxibustion robots, meridian detectors), wearable sensors, and special space designs for physical demonstration projects.
3.  <b>Method Patents:</b>
    *   In jurisdictions that allow the granting of medical method/business method patents, we claim patent protection for specific "HHPF Standardized Treatment Procedures (SOPs)" and "Health Engineering Management Systems."



## III. Trade Secrets (Trade Secrets) —— Core Confidentiality Shield
Some wisdom we choose to share publicly for universal benefit, but some core parameters are the keys to ensuring the safe operation of the system and belong to HHPF's highest secrets.

1.  <b>RAG Core Database:</b>
    The "high-trust medical case database" and "A/B test raw data" that have been cleaned, annotated, and verified by HHPF are core trade secrets.
2.  <b>SOP Key Parameters:</b>
    Although we publicly share SOP operating procedures, the <b>fine-tuning parameters, compatibility logic, and contraindication algorithms</b> for specific serious diseases are "black box" secrets of the SMD system and are strictly prohibited from disclosure.
3.  <b>Operational Secrets:</b>
    HHPF's donor lists, volunteer databases, partner hospital channels, internal management processes, and unpublished strategic plans.
4.  <b>Protection Measures:</b>
    All core employees, volunteers, and partners who come into contact with the above information must sign a strict <b>Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</b>. Any leakage will face severe legal sanctions and industry bans.



## IV. Digital Assets (Digital Assets) —— Cyberspace Territory Shield
In the Internet era, domain names and accounts are HHPF's "digital real estate."

1.  <b>Domain Name Protection:</b>
    *   Official main domain names (such as `hhp.foundation`) and their related top-level domains.
    *   Major project subdomains (such as `sm.doctor`).
    *   We reserve the right to arbitrate and recover "misleading domain names" maliciously registered in connection with HHPF.
2.  <b>Social Media Authentication:</b>
    *   HHPF's officially verified accounts on major global social platforms (X/Twitter, Facebook, WeChat, TikTok, YouTube) are the only channels for us to release authoritative information.



## V. Enforcement of Rights (Enforcement)
HHPF implements a <b>"zero-tolerance"</b> policy against intellectual property infringement.

1.  <b>Global Monitoring:</b> We use AI technology to monitor counterfeit HHPF-branded websites, APPs, and offline stores across the entire network.
2.  <b>Anti-Counterfeiting Actions:</b> For institutions that produce or sell counterfeit health products with HHPF logos, or engage in illegal medical practice under the SMD banner, we will work with local law enforcement agencies to conduct administrative investigations or criminal crackdowns.
3.  <b>Blacklist Mechanism:</b> Infringing entities will be included in the HHPF ecosystem blacklist and permanently prohibited from participating in any HHPF procurement, cooperation, or certification projects.

## [Conclusion]
Intellectual property belongs not only to HHPF but also to all humanity.
Protecting it is protecting the spark of innovation and protecting every ordinary person seeking health from fraud. We invite the whole society to supervise together and guard this pure land.
