# Licensing Model

## Preface
<h3>-- Open Sharing, Orderly Empowerment</h3>

> The vision of the Human Health Plan Foundation (HHPF) is to "make health knowledge universally accessible to the public." Therefore, we oppose closed technological monopolies. However, given the special nature of the medical and health field—where any incorrect execution can be life-threatening—we have established a management system of <b>"strict entry, lenient exit, and hierarchical authorization"</b>.
We welcome global partners to use HHPF's brand, technology, and content under legal, compliant, and standardized conditions to jointly promote the upgrading of human health civilization.

## II. Gold Channel: Commercial and Professional Authorization
<b>——Strict Review, Paid/Exchange Cooperation</b>

    *   Research results must be published with HHPF as a co-research institution.



## IV. Application Process (Application Process)

We have formulated standardized authorization SOPs to ensure fairness and efficiency:

1.  <b>Submit Application (Submit):</b>
    *   Visit the "Partners" page on the official website and fill out the "HHPF Authorization Cooperation Application Form", clearly stating the type of authorization and usage scenarios.
2.  <b>Qualification Pre-review (Review):</b>
    *   The HHPF Authorization Committee will review within 5 working days. Core review criteria: <b>whether values match (truth-seeking/benevolence)</b> and whether qualifications are compliant.
3.  <b>Sign Agreement (Sign):</b>
    *   After passing the review, both parties sign the "Intellectual Property Authorization Agreement", clearly defining rights, obligations, duration, and fees (if applicable).
4.  <b>Empowerment and Supervision (Empower & Monitor):</b>
    *   HHPF provides technical access and VI material packages. At the same time, a monitoring mechanism is activated. Once illegal use is discovered (such as false propaganda, substandard services), the <b>"circuit breaker mechanism"</b> will be triggered immediately, terminating the authorization and pursuing accountability.



## V. Contact and Consultation (Contact)

## To Every Friend Who Reads This Far

Rules are not meant to restrict, but to better coordinate.
Through this licensing system, we replicate HHPF's DNA to partners around the world.
Whether you are an individual using free knowledge, a business partner operating a chain organization, or a scientist exploring the unknown, as long as you are within the rules, <b>HHPF is your backing, and SMD is your brain.</b>

Let us join hands to let this future-oriented health paradigm benefit all humanity under the protection of the rule of law and contracts.
