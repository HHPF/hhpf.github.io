# Public Welfare Fundraising

## Preface
<h3>-- Raising Funds for the Construction of "Infrastructure" for Human Health</h3>

> Every penny raised through public welfare fundraising will not be used for commercial dividends, but will be fully invested in basic construction and humanitarian aid with <b>high thresholds, high risks, long cycles, and low direct returns</b>. We define this as the <b>"Health Infrastructure Project"</b>.

## I. Fund Usage: Four Cornerstones of Public Welfare (MECE Decomposition)
1.  <b>AI and Data Infrastructure (SMD R&D):</b>
    *   Support the training computing power costs of SMD general large models.
    *   Build a global natural medicine database.
    *   Ensure that the SMD system is <b>permanently free</b> for users in global poverty-stricken areas.
2.  <b>Standardization Engineering Research (R&D):</b>
    *   Fund A/B testing and clinical validation of natural therapies and psychological therapies.
    *   Compile and open-source the "HHPF Global Health SOP Manual".
    *   This part of the investment is huge and has no short-term commercial returns, so it must be supported by public welfare funds.
3.  <b>Humanitarian Medical Aid (Medical Aid):</b>
    *   Establish the <b>"HHPF Life Relief Fund"</b>, specially used to fund treatment for critically ill patients without payment ability.
    *   Support the construction of "HHPF Community Micro-Stations" in underdeveloped areas.
4.  <b>Universal Health Education (Education):</b>
    *   Produce high-quality health science content.
    *   Conduct free online public courses on the "Manual for Life Use".

## II. Fundraising Plan: Diversified Donation Matrix
1.  <b>Strategic Philanthropists and Family Foundations:</b>
    *   *Target:* Global high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs).
    *   *Plan:* Establish the <b>"HHPF Founding Council"</b>. Donors not only receive tax deductions but also enjoy the highest honor of HHPF, engraving their family names on the milestone of human health transformation.
2.  <b>Corporate CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Cooperation:</b>
    *   *Target:* Insurance companies, technology giants, large pharmaceutical companies.
    *   *Plan:* Jointly establish special funds (such as "HHPF-XX Enterprise Depression Prevention and Treatment Fund"). Enterprises gain brand reputation and ESG rating improvement, while HHPF gains funds and technical support.
3.  <b>Public Monthly Donation Plan (Crowdfunding):</b>
    *   *Target:* Every ordinary person who benefits from HHPF.
    *   *Plan:* <b>"Health Mutual Aid Plan"</b>. Advocate "donating 1 yuan per day" to accumulate small amounts into great sums. Let beneficiaries become donors, forming a cycle of love.\n
