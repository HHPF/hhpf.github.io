## [Preface: Looking for the "Minority" Who Define the Future]
If you're tired of being an alienated screw in a big factory, if you're disgusted by the unspoken rules in the medical industry that sacrifice patient interests for KPIs, if you believe that the combination of AI and life sciences will reshape human civilization — <b>welcome home.</b>
HHPF is looking for the smartest minds and warmest hearts on this planet. We invite you to step out of traditional career paths and join this paradigm revolution about life, health, and consciousness. Here, your code will save lives, your solutions will eliminate suffering, and your work will become part of history.



## I. Talent Profile: What Kind of "New Human" Do We Need?
We don't value your Title in the old world; we value your Potential in the new world. The ideal candidate for HHPF must possess the following <b>"trinity"</b> of traits:

1.  <b>First Principles Thinker:</b>
    Don't blindly follow authority, don't superstitiously believe in dogma. Able to see through complex medical appearances and hit the underlying logic of the life system.
2.  <b>Interdisciplinary Weaver:</b>
    Understand both code and meridians, both psychology and data analysis. Can build bridges between "silicon-based intelligence (AI)" and "carbon-based life (humans)."
3.  <b>Long-termist:</b>
    Have the ability to delay gratification. Willing to endure loneliness and win tough battles for the grand vision of "human health upgrading."
