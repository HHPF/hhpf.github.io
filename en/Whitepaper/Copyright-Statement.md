# Copyright Statement

## [Preface: Protecting Wisdom is Protecting Life]
The white papers, theoretical systems, SOP standards, and related content released by the Human Health Plan Foundation (HHPF) are not just combinations of words and code, but also the crystallization of wisdom from the HHPF team, expert volunteers, and partners in the exploration of a "paradigm shift."
We advocate for <b>"knowledge equality"</b> and encourage dissemination for public welfare purposes; however, we must prevent professional medical knowledge from being <b>tampered with, taken out of context, or used for unauthorized commercial profit</b> through strict copyright protection. This concerns not only intellectual property rights but also the life safety of users.
